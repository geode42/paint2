An incomplete infinite-canvas painting website: [paint.geode42.com](https://paint.geode42.com/)

### Shortcuts
Hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>LMB</kbd> and move your mouse left/right to resize the brush (similar to PS) (doesn't work on firefox + macos for now :( )  
While using the hand tool, hold <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>LMB</kbd> and move your mouse left/right to zoom in/out  
Alternatively, while using the hand tool hold <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> or <kbd>alt</kbd> and click to zoom in/out  
Alternatively-alternatively, hold <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd> and scroll to zoom in/out  
Use <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>-<kbd>z</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>z</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl/cmd</kbd>-<kbd>y</kbd> to undo/redo  
Hold <kbd>space</kbd> to temporarily get the hand tool  
Use <kbd>v</kbd>, <kbd>h</kbd>, and <kbd>b</kbd> to switch to the selection, hand, and brush tools respectively  
Scroll to move around, use pinch-to-zoom on your trackpad if your device supports it  
There's a custom color picker on the bottom left  
That's about it :)

### Random comments
This website changes your mouse cursor natively for as long as it can, so there's minimal latency  
Turns out you can make (perfect) rainbows and hsv gradients in pure CSS which is neat  
MacOS and Firefox cause sadness and grief
