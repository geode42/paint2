# paint2

A simple and incomplete painting website

Hold <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>LMB</kbd> and move your mouse left/right to resize the brush (similar to PS)  
Use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>z</kbd> / <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>z</kbd> to undo/redo  
There's a custom color picker on the bottom left  
That's about it :)

Random comments:  
This website changes your mouse cursor natively for as long as it can, so there's minimal latency  
Turns out you can make (perfect) rainbows and hsv gradients in pure CSS which is neat
